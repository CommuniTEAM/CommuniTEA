## Working with Git Hooks

Any commits to the repository must conform to the formatting rulesets for the following:
- Commit Messages
- ESLint TypeScript
- Golang (TBD)

To enforce these conventions, [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), a Git hook manager, is a required development dependency for the project. You will need to install it on your local machine.

### Installing Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit.<br>
**Windows**:
Pre-commit runs off of Python, so you will need pip on your local machine. To install pre-commit, open your terminal and run `pip install pre-commit`.<br>
**Mac or Linux**:
Ensure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your local machine. To install pre-commit, open your terminal and run `brew install pre-commit`.

2. Install the repository's Git hooks by navigating to the repo's directory in your terminal and running `pre-commit install`.

And that's all! You're now ready to commit to the repository.
For more detailed installation information and troubleshooting, see the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

### Pre-Commit Rulesets

#### Commit Message Format

All commit messages, regardless of the branch, must adhere to this header standard:
```
<Emoji> [Related Jira Issue]: Description of work
```
Example: `‚úÖ [TEA-123]: Added unit tests`

These are the allowed emojis and their use-cases:
- ‚ú®: New feature
- üêû: Bug fix
- ‚úÖ: Added or updated tests
- üöß: Work in progress
- üî®: Refactored
- üìù: Documentation updated
- ü§ù: Merged branches

Special thanks to strdr4605 for their [walkthrough](https://strdr4605.com/commitlint-custom-commit-message-with-emojis) of this configuration!

#### ESLint TypeScript Format

The ESLint configuration for this repository uses the [guide by Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). The installed pre-commit hook will attempt to fix any linting errors found in the staged changes. If it does, the check will fail and you will need to re-stage and commit.

Please be sure to have the [Prettier VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) installed and format your code often. The included workspace settings for VSCode set Prettier as the default formatter for TypeScript and JavaScript. To format the current file quickly, do a manual save (Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+S`  Mac: `‚åòS`).

#### Golang Format

This repository uses a robust [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) configuration built up of over 75 linters, as recommended in the ["Golden Config" by maratori](https://gist.github.com/maratori/47a4d00457a92aa426dbd48a18776322). To successfully run the pre-commit hook, a local installation of golanci-lint is required. Follow the [official documentation](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) to get started, or see the installation instructions below.

##### Installing golangci-lint on Mac or Linux Systems

**Mac**: First, ensure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. Then, in your terminal, run:
```
brew install golangci-lint
brew upgrade golangci-lint
```

**Linux**: If your distro has Snap, you can simply run:
```
sudo snap install golangci-lint
```
Alternatively, you can manually install the binary by running:
```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s v1.55.2
```

##### Installing golangci-lint on Windows Systems

Unfortunately installation on Windows is not as straightforward, as golangci-lint runs off of bash. If you do not already have a bash terminal, it is recommended to install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) so that you have the Git Bash terminal available.

In your bash terminal, install the golangci-lint binary by running:
```
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s v1.55.2
```

**Note:** golangci-lint can *only* run inside a bash terminal. To run the pre-commit hook for Go, you must also run `git commit` inside of your bash terminal.

### Using Git Hooks in VSCode

When commiting changes through VSCode's source control tab, pre-commit will still run automatically without issues. If a hook fails, however, VSCode will throw you an error. In that case, click on "Show Command Output" as per the screenshot below to see the errors returned from pre-commit.
