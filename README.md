## Working with Git Hooks

Any commits to the repository must conform to the formatting rulesets for the following:
- Commit Messages
- ESLint TypeScript
- Golang (TBD)

To enforce these conventions, [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), a Git hook manager, is a required development dependency for the project. You will need to install it on your local machine.

### Installation Pre-Commit

1. Install pre-commit.
**Windows**:
Pre-commit runs off of Python, so you will need pip on your local machine. To install pre-commit, open your terminal and run `pip install pre-commit`.
**Mac or Linux**:
Ensure you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on your local machine. To install pre-commit, open your terminal and run `brew install pre-commit`.

2. Install the repository's Git hooks by navigating to the repo's directory in your terminal and running `pre-commit install`.

And that's all! You're now ready to commit to the repository.
For more detailed installation information and troubleshooting, see the [pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/#install).

### Pre-Commit Rulesets

#### Commit Message Format

All commit messages, regardless of the branch, must adhere to this header standard:
```<Emoji> [Related Jira Issue]: Description of work```
Example: `‚úÖ [TEA-123]: Added unit tests`

These are the allowed emojis and their use-cases:
- ‚ú®: New feature
- üêû: Bug fix
- ‚úÖ: Added or updated tests
- üöß: Work in progress
- ‚ôªÔ∏è: Refactored
- üìù: Documentation updated

Special thanks to strdr4605 for their [walkthrough](https://strdr4605.com/commitlint-custom-commit-message-with-emojis) of this configuration!

#### ESLint TypeScript Format

The ESLint configuration for this repository uses the [guide by Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). The installed pre-commit hook will attempt to fix any linting errors found in the staged changes. If it does, the check will fail and you will need to re-stage and commit.

Please be sure to have the [Prettier VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) installed and format your code often. The included workspace settings for VSCode set Prettier as the default formatter for TypeScript and JavaScript. To format the current file quickly, do a manual save (Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+S`  Mac: `‚åòS`).

#### Golang Format

TBD.

### Using Git Hooks in VSCode

When commiting changes through VSCode's source control tab, pre-commit will still run automatically without issues. If a hook fails, however, VSCode will throw you an error. In that case, click on "Show Command Output" as per the screenshot below.
